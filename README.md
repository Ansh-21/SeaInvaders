# SeaInvaders
A small Space Invaders clone coded from scratch using python and pygame.

This actually took so much work and bugfixing to get to this point, and it's absolutely terrible. There isn't even gameplay. I mean, most of the work I've done is preparing for the future, but I haven't ***got*** to the future yet!


# TODO:

1. Get the basic gameplay:  
	a. Add randomly spawning fish (done)  
	b. Add a controllable blaster (done)  
	c. Add bullets that spawn from the blaster and deapawn at the top (done)  
	d. Make the bullets kill the fish  
2. Get the complicated gameplay:  
	a. Add lives  
	b. Make yourself lose lives when a fish is let through  
3. TBC
